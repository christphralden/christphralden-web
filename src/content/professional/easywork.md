problem: "Unemployment in Indonesia is exacerbated by a lack of financial literacy, formal education, and accessible resources for skill development. This results in significant wage gaps and disparities in quality of life. Additionally, many individuals, even those with sufficient education and qualifications, struggle to find jobs that align with their skills and personality. This challenge is compounded by the difficulty in recognizing personal deficiencies, which hinders growth and career development."
solution: "Easywork is an AI-powered application designed to reduce unemployment and close the wage gap in Indonesia. By leveraging Large Language Models, vector databases, and Pinecone AI, the app automates the tedious job search process and provides personalized job opportunities. Users input their educational background, work experience, and other relevant information, and EasyWork either connects them to real job opportunities or suggests targeted courses to help them develop the necessary skills for their dream job."
