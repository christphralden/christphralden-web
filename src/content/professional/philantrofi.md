problem: "The traditional charity sector often suffers from a lack of transparency, making it difficult for donors to track how their contributions are being used. This lack of visibility can lead to mistrust and inefficiencies in fund allocation, with donors unsure if their money is reaching the intended recipients and being used effectively."
solution: "PhilanthroFi is an innovative Web-3 application built on the Internet Computer blockchain that addresses these issues by recording all charity transactions on-chain. Utilizing advanced canister technology, the app provides full transparency by allowing donors to track their contributions in real-time. Before the funds are sent to the fundraiser's wallet, an invoice must be attached, so that validators can ensure that funds are used efficiently. This empowers donors to make informed decisions and ensures that their contributions are being used effectively."
